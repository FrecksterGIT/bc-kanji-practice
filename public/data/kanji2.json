    "meaning_mnemonic": "This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: 人々 is actually 人人. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the <kanji>repeater</kanji>. It repeats what comes before it.\n\nTo remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a <radical>drop</radical> of water dripping into a <radical>prison</radical>. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again, driving the prisoners nuts. But it never stops. It just repeats over and over.",

She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling \"<reading>No ma</reading>!\" (のま) but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever.",
